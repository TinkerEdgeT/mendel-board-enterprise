These files are required to flash the Mendel Linux OS to an attached device
using fastboot:

1. On your host computer, install the `fastboot` tool.
2. Using either the serial console or the `fastboot` tool, put the device into
   fastboot mode.
3. Connect to the device using a USB cable, attached to the device's USB data
   "OTG" port.
4. Run the `flash.sh` script in this directory.

Note: The recovery.img file is just the U-Boot image. Use that to recover a
failing device by flashing it to an SD card and booting from that (also follow
the previous link for details).
